/*
 * A library for normalizing dictionaries in Javascript.
 * Where "normalizing" means making key names equal by renaming keys,
 * merging objects which contain equal key-value pairs, and transforming
 * values by running functions on them.
 *
 * the Neurotypical class also takes a dictionary to the constructor,
 * allowing you to configure exactly how you want stuff to be normalized.
